## NBA Heat Check

Check out how your favorite players have been perfoming recently with their season averages, stats from last ten game, and a look at what people are saying about them on twitter right now! With a nice chart to compare stats and visually see how they're playing

Responsive and with dark mode, get a nice visual display of all you need to know to win your current basketball debate

## What I want to Add Next 
- Instead of comparing individual stats, I'll make it so user can compare the stats of two different players in the line graph
- Listen for other suggestions
